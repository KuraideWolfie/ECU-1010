Description: <br/>
Algorithmic Problem Solving is, essentially, the introductory programming course offered at ECU. It exposes students to variables, if-else statements, while/for loops, and other basic programming constructs and knowledge. The assignments of the course are more basic, placing emphasis more on getting use to the idea of compilation, testing, and debugging. Each ‘assignment’ for this course is more about expressing simple programs in code, and each one contains more than one part. As such, compilation and testing will be provided for all parts. <br/>
