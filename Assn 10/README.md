### Assignment Description
This assignment was split into two parts:

- <b>ArraySum.java:</b> Allows a user to enter an arbitrary count of integers, summing them together and then showing the percentage influence of each integer on the total sum
### Source Files

```
Part 1:

```
Issues:
- Originally, I made a mistake in ArraySum.java during the summation of the array; this has been corrected prior to submission here
