## Assignment 10
### Assignment Description
This assignment was split into two parts:
- <b>CharCount.java:</b> Counts the frequencies of the different letters in a user-entered sentence, displaying these frequencies to the screen afterward
- <b>ArraySum.java:</b> Allows a user to enter an arbitrary count of integers, summing them together and then showing the percentage influence of each integer on the total sum
### Source Files
<b>Part 1:</b> CharCount.java <br/>
<b>Part 2:</b> ArraySum.java <br/>
### Compilation, Testing, and Known Issues
```
Part 1:
Compile: javac CharCount.java
Testing: java CharCount

Part 2:
Compile: javac ArraySum.java
Testing: java ArraySum
```
Issues:
- Originally, I made a mistake in ArraySum.java during the summation of the array; this has been corrected prior to submission here
Notes:
- Numbers (0-9) and special characters(!, ?, etc) are not counted in CharCount; only letters are counted
